                Alpha
            </p>
            <p>
                Alpha (uppercase Α, lowercase α) is the first letter of the Greek
                alphabet. In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of one. 
                Alpha is derived from the Phoenician letter aleph aleph, which is 
                the West Semitic word for "ox". Letters that arose from alpha 
                include the Latin letter A and the Cyrillic letter А.

            <p>
                Beta (uppercase Β, lowercase β, or cursive ϐ) is the second letter
                of the Greek alphabet. In the system of Greek numerals, it has a 
                value of 2. In Ancient Greek, beta represented the voiced bilabial 
                plosive /b/. In Modern Greek, it represents the voiced labiodental 
                fricative /v/ (while /b/ in foreign words is instead commonly 
                transcribed as μπ). Letters that arose from beta include the Roman 
                letter ⟨B⟩ and the Cyrillic letters ⟨Б⟩ and ⟨В⟩.

                Gamma
            </p>
            <p>
                Gamma (uppercase Γ, lowercase γ) is the third letter of the Greek 
                alphabet. In the system of Greek numerals it has a value of 3. In 
                Ancient Greek, the letter gamma represented a voiced velar stop 
                /ɡ/. In Modern Greek, this letter represents either a voiced velar 
                fricative /ɣ/ or a voiced palatal fricative /ʝ/ (while /g/ in 
                foreign words is instead commonly transcribed as γκ).
